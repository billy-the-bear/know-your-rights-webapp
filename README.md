# Know Your Rights #

### *A Directory of Individual Rights and Liberties*

This directory contains a Flask web app that serves to document individual rights and liberties on a state-by-state basis pertaining to subjects such as traffic stops, protests, and school searches.

Not currently hosting the web app, but it is possible to host locally. Once hosted, enter the desired state abbreviation to access its local regulations.
